# HTML Basics #

### Wireframing ###

Wireframing at its core is a tangible form of brainstorming for code. It allows you to illustrate whether through pen or different online programs what you would want your website to look like. It specifically focuses on the User interface and experience aspect of the website or app. This is a very crucial process to the web development cycle but it's level of detail can vary depending on what your goals are. For instance, if your site's visual design is already set or not as important, which is often the case with backend administrative interfaces, then going from a simple sketch directly to coding is probably the best plan. However, if that's not the case then more time, effort, and resources may be dedicated to a high-def wireframe and then proceeding through a testing cycle with an interactive protype.


### HTML ###
 
 
  HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. This coding language is used to structure a web page and the content on that web page. With HTML you use various tags, elements, and content to make it appear a certain way on that page. HTML works in the same way that a skeleton does for the body.
